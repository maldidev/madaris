# Madaris
Micro example for Installation Manager.


## how to work
First, you need to change `src/utils/installer.py', just view it huh


Second is just run main.py, or
```bash
# Go to main source directory and:
> python main.py
```


### Help
Just change some scripts, and add logo to `src/assets/logo.png`
